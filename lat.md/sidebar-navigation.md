# Sidebar recent sessions

The sidebar has no standalone "Sessions" nav item — the recent-chats list lives directly under the **Chat** nav item (ChatGPT-style), and the full session list opens in a modal via "Show more".

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] special-cases the `chat` entry of `NAV_ITEMS` to render the Chat button, a collapse chevron (state persisted under `hermes.sidebar.sessionsExpanded`), and [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarRecentSessions.tsx]] beneath it. There is no `sessions` view in the `View` union.

## Inline list and "Show more"

The inline list shows at most `RECENT_SESSIONS_LIMIT` (5) most-recent sessions; a "Show more" button appears only when the profile has more than that.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarRecentSessions.tsx]] fetches one row over the limit (from the `sessions.json` cache, then a `state.db` sync) so a single query decides whether to render the button — it slices to 5 for display and sets `hasMore` from the raw length. Clicking it calls `onShowMore`, which opens the full-list modal.

## Full-list modal

"Show more" (and the Cmd/Ctrl+K menu action) open an 80%×80% modal that reuses the existing Sessions screen rather than a separate route.

The modal in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] renders [[src/renderer/src/screens/Sessions/Sessions.tsx]] inside a `.sessions-modal` over the shared `.models-modal-overlay` backdrop. Resuming a session or starting a new chat from the modal closes it; Esc and a backdrop click also close it. Because the Sessions screen owns its own fetching gated on `visible`, it loads only while the modal is open.
